 Analyzed claim data and performed data cleaning (viz. handling missing and duplicate values, changing to appropriate data types, etc.). I conducted several analyses such as customer analysis (e.g. 62.77% of total claim amount claimed by Male), types of claims, fraudulent claims (most fraudulent claim by adult (30-60 years - 190 claims least claim by youth (<18 years â€“ 20 claims), trend in insurance claims, etc. I also performed hypothesis testing for gender-wise claims (amount claimed by male and female is similar), relationship between category and segment (no significant relationship between Age group and segment), relationship between no. of policy claims and claim amount (there is no relationship between total number of policy claims and the claimed amount).
